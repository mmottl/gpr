(** {2 Feature-rich ("fat") squared exponential covariance} *)

(** The covariance is defined as:

    [k(x, y) = sf^2 * exp(-1/2 * |(Q_i*P*(x-y))|^2)]

    where [sf^2] is the amplitude, [P] a general [d*D] dimensionality reduction
    matrix ([d << D]), and [Q_i] is a [d*d] diagonal matrix containing all
    multiscales for inducing input number [i].

    Note that multiscales must not get smaller than [0.5] in this framework,
    because the overall length scale is considered to be equal to [1], which
    imposes this mathematical constraint for positive-definiteness. There is no
    need for a variable global length scale, because the dimensionality
    reduction matrix already generalizes this feature anyway. Hence an
    unconstrained multiscale parameter [q] is stored as [log(q - 0.5)].

    If [x] and [y] are the same inducing input, then and only then extra noise
    (a different noise level for each inducing input) will be added for
    heteroskedasticity.

    Dimensionality reduction, heteroskedasticity, and multiscales are optional
    features and can be easily turned off by setting the parameters to [None].
